# caesar_cipher

Simple python program I made to encrypt and decrypt a message with a simple caesar cipher for my Computer Security class at Waynesburg University (CSC 409)

- This program encrypts and decrypts text with a caesar shift, the shift amount which the user chooses (positive for right, negative for left)
- Just run the program, the instructions should be pretty clear and self explanatory
- I also tried to handle all the possible input errors that could occur
- This program only shifts letters of the alphabet, all other characters are left the same
